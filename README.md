# Prototyping Virtual Reality Interaction in Unity

In the lecture, we saw three different approaches to interacting with objects in virtual reality scenes. In this practical, we are going to see how to implement these interactions in Unity using the HTC Vive. We'll start off by learning how to use Vive's inbuilt support for these interactions and then learn how they work by re-implementing them ourselves from scratch!

You should work in groups around the computers that have the VR headsets attached. When deploying your VR experiences, make sure that another team member ‘spots’ the user to make sure they don’t bump or trip into any furniture of fellow students.

To get started, make a copy of this repository in your personal GitHub account using the ```Use This Template`` button at the top right of this page, then clone that repository onto the machine you're working on and open it in Unity. As with last time, if all group members would like a copy of the work at the end of the practical, you can simply push the repo up onto everyone's personal account at the end of the session (ask if you want help with this).
